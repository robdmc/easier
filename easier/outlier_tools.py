    Recursively remove outliers from a series using sigma editing method.

    This function iteratively identifies and removes outliers that fall outside

    until no more outliers are found or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

    Args:
        in_series (pandas.Series): Input series containing numeric values
        sigma_thresh (float): Number of standard deviations to use as threshold
        iter_counter (Counter, optional): Counter to track iterations. Defaults to None
        max_iter (int, optional): Maximum number of iterations allowed. Defaults to 20

    Returns:
        pandas.Series: Series with outliers replaced by NaN values

    Raises:
        ValueError: If input series has no non-NaN values
        ValueError: If maximum number of iterations is exceeded

    Remove outliers from data using recursive sigma editing method.

    This function identifies and removes outliers by recursively applying sigma editing,

    are set to NaN. For 2D arrays and dataframes, all elements are included in the sample.

    Args:
        data (ndarray, Series, or DataFrame): Input data containing numeric values
        sigma_thresh (float, optional): Number of standard deviations to use as threshold
            for outlier detection. Defaults to 3.
        max_iter (int, optional): Maximum number of iterations allowed for the recursive
            sigma editing process. Defaults to 20.

    Returns:
        ndarray, Series, or DataFrame: Data with outliers replaced by NaN values,
            maintaining the original shape of the input.

    Note:
        The function uses a recursive approach where each iteration recalculates the mean

    Args:
        data (ndarray, Series, or DataFrame): Input data containing numeric values
        multiple (float, optional): The IQR multiple to use for outlier detection.
            Values outside the range [Q1 - multiple*IQR, Q3 + multiple*IQR] are

    Note:
        The IQR method is robust to outliers and works well for non-normal distributions.
