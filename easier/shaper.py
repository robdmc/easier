    Datasets come in a variety of containers and sometimes you
    want to pass the data to a function that requires a one-dimenional
    container (usually an array).

    This class provides an easy method of transforming your data to
    and from a 1-dimentional series and back, preserving the containers
    shape (and columns/indexes for pandas objects.)

    The "flattened" data will always be a pandas series.

    The call signature is the same for all allowed datatypes.
